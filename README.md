> I discovered this [free template](https://astro.build/themes/details/minimal-bento-like-portfolio/) from the list of [Atro Themes](https://astro.build/themes/1/?search=&categories%5B%5D=portfolio&price%5B%5D=free). This version is a fork of [**Ladvace/astro-bento-portfolio**](https://github.com/Ladvace/astro-bento-portfolio) with a couple of minor tweaks and updated to a more recent version of Astro.

> It seems to be a nice starting point to A) introduce my students to Astro and B) encourage them to begin developing a personal portfolio project.
